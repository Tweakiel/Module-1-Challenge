# Module 1 Challenge


## Description 📖
For this module, we were given a starting code and our task was to modify it with consideration to the User Story and Acceptance Criteria (Refer Below). Regardless of how the code was changed, the website should still look the same (Refer to Website Demonstration Below). I approached this challenge by using HTML Semantics and efficiently reformatting my css so that it is using less lines and formed into groups. I Personally enjoyed this module since it really opened my eyes into the plethora of ways that anything could be coded, this also teaches us code could be simplified in order to be more efficient when working.

## User Story
- AS AN employer
- I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
- SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria ✔️
- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
- WHEN I load their portfolio
- THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
- THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
- THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
- THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- WHEN I click on the images of the applications
- THEN I am taken to that deployed application
- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
- THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
